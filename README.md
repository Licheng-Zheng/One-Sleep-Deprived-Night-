Licheng Zheng's submission to the 2024 Space City Hackathon - Play as a knight while learning about machine learning 

All the assets I used for this project are from: https://brackeysgames.itch.io/brackeys-platformer-bundle from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0

Here is the link to the youtube video demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFOrC5y7Tpw
